# Local Provider

The local provider implements resources that operate on the local system.

They are atypical, as most resources represent a single real world entity that is reached over the network, but a resource like `file` is not singular like that, when NixOps4 is invoked from different environments.

## Resource Types

- [configured](./configured.md) <!-- TODO: add shortDescription when implemented -->
- [simple](./simple.md) <!-- TODO: add shortDescription when implemented -->
- [stateful](./stateful.md) <!-- TODO: add shortDescription when implemented -->
